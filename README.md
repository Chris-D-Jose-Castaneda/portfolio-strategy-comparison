# Portfolio Strategy Comparison

This project analyzes different investment strategies starting from **$1,000 on April 7, 2025**, using data from Refinitiv Workspace.  
The strategies include:

- **Cash_0** â€” $1,000 in a savings account at 0%.
- **HYSA_3p5** â€” $1,000 in a 3.5% APY high-yield savings account.
- **BH_Combined** â€” Buy & Hold with equal allocation across ETFs (QQQ/QQQM, SPY, VOO, VTI, SCHD).
- **Signal_EQW_MA** â€” A dynamic signal strategy: equal-weighting only assets with **MA(50) > MA(200)**; idle cash earns HYSA.
